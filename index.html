						The proposed idea for this project was to enhance risk assessment/management, compliance and
						governance in an organisation. IT strategy is an extension of the enterprise business strategy
						and it’s important for every company to implement this. I decided to start this project because
						of my internship. I worked in IT Security and one of the problems my colleagues faced was what
						risk assessment compliance tool they should use.
						To solve this problem I made a comparison of different risk assessment compliance tools and
						decided which one’s are of value. My own equipment e.g. desktop and/or laptop was used to test
						the risk assessment and compliance tools. The operating systems I used to test the risk
						complaince tools were Windows 10, Linux Fedora and Linux Ubuntu.
						<br><br>
						<h4>Example of Risk Compliance Tools that were used</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>OpenSCAP</li>
							<li>CIS-CAT</li>
							<li>Microsoft Security Compliance Toolkit</li>
						</ul>

						A group project composed of three people. The objective for this project was to find a dataset
						and to analise the affect the data from the dataset have on each other.
						Juniper Notebook was used as the IDE and Python was the language we used to discover data
						points. The dataset we chose was Internet connections in households from the years 2006 and
						2011.
						We used Python to filter and create graphs from the data. The graphs were used to identify
						trends or changes in the data when comapring against each other.
						Calculations for correlation coefficient, central tendancy and variabillity were also used for this project.
						In the end we found out that there was a steady rise of internet connections in homes from 2006
						to 2011, as expected.

						This project was a group project composed of three people. The objective for
						this project was to create a website using Java, Scala and HTML.
						My team agreed to create a movie type website which has access to all the latest movies. There
						were three iteration for this project each with its own major objectives.
						<br><br>
						Iteration one was to figure out the structure of the website and starting the process of coming
						up with a template. Iteration two was to build the website with the ideas from
						iteration one and adding feature like a basket or login system. Iteration three was to polish
						the website and make it look somewhat proffessional, any final features like password
						encryption,
						security for logins, user accounts, registrations and contacts were also configured from
						iteration two.
						<br><br>
						Finally to explain how the website functions. New users can register onto the
						website from the registration page.
						They can then login and select any movie they wuld like to purchase. A purchase requires the
						user to enter their banking information which will then be saftley stored onto the database and
						movie delivered to the user digitally.
						The admin account can edit, add and delete movies. The admin also has a control over the prices
						of movies.

					<br><br>
					I was working for Folens over the summer of 2019 for three months. My main role there was to be a
					tester for their digital products and also some lite HTML editing was also involved for this role.
					I mainly tested digital schoolbooks for primary and post-primary subjects. I had to test the digital
					products by looking for broken links, spelling mistakes, sounds and videos.
					I had to make sure the sound wasn't too loud or too quite and that the video macthed the content of
					the page.
					<br><br>
					Working with folens had offered me to work in an office environment and it was my first time working
					in such an environment so I got used to it before joining FBD for my work placement.
